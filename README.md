# Analyzing the Correlation Between Air Pollution and Lung Cancer Incidence Across United States


## Project Proposal

This project aims to examine the relationship between air pollution levels and lung cancer incidence across different U.S. states. Using publicly available data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the study will analyze whether higher concentrations of pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, and NOâ‚‚ are correlated with increased lung cancer rates.

## Goals

-Analyzing the correlation between air pollution levels and lung cancer incidence across U.S. states. 
-Visualizing patterns and trends in both air quality and lung cancer data over time (2010â€“2023).
-Evaluating how geographical factors (urban vs. rural states) influence this relationship.
-Demonstrating how open-source data can be used for environmental health research using data science methods.
-Providing insights that can inform policymakers and raise awareness about environmental health risks.

## Resources

###Datasets:

-EPA Air Quality System (AQS): Annual state-level pollutant data (PM2.5, PM10, NOâ‚‚, Oâ‚ƒ).
ðŸ”— https://www.epa.gov/aqs
-CDC U.S. Cancer Statistics (USCS): Lung cancer incidence by state and year.
ðŸ”— https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/uscs/
-U.S. Census Bureau: Population estimates for normalization.
ðŸ”— https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest.html

###Tools and Software:

-Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning and visualization.
-Jupyter Notebook for analysis and documentation.
-Excel / Google Sheets for initial data inspection and merging.

## Data Collection

###Cancer Data (CDC):

-Collect lung cancer rates by state and year from the CDC website.
-Make a simple table showing each stateâ€™s cancer rate over time and look for patterns or trends, like which states have higher rates.

###Pollution Data (EPA):

-Gather air pollution data (PM2.5, PM10, NOâ‚‚, and Oâ‚ƒ) from the EPA website.
-Look at basic graphs or maps to see how pollution changes from place to place or year to year.

###Combining and Analyzing:

-Combine both datasets by matching the same state and year.
-Compare the numbers to see if places with higher pollution also have higher cancer rates.
-Use simple charts or correlation results to show how strong the relationship is and which pollutants seem most related to lung cancer.

##Expected Outcomes

This project is expected to reveal a positive correlation between air pollution levels and lung cancer incidence across U.S. states. Pollutants such as PM2.5 and NOâ‚‚ are anticipated to show stronger relationships with higher cancer rates, especially in more industrial or urban regions. The results will be presented through visualizations like charts and maps to highlight geographical patterns. Overall, the findings aim to raise awareness about the health impacts of poor air quality and demonstrate how open data can be used to support public health and environmental policy decisions.
